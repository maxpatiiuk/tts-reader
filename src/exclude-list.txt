With no shareholders or billionaire owner, we can set our own agenda and provide trustworthy journalism that‚Äôs free from commercial and political influence, offering a counterweight to the spread of misinformation. When it‚Äôs never mattered more, we can investigate and challenge without fear or favour.
Unlike many others, Guardian journalism is available for everyone to read, regardless of what they can afford to pay. We do this because we believe in information equality. Greater numbers of people can keep track of global events, understand their impact on people and communities, and become inspired to take meaningful action.
