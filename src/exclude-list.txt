With no shareholders or billionaire owner, we can set our own agenda and provide trustworthy journalism that‚Äôs free from commercial and political influence, offering a counterweight to the spread of misinformation. When it‚Äôs never mattered more, we can investigate and challenge without fear or favour.
Unlike many others, Guardian journalism is available for everyone to read, regardless of what they can afford to pay. We do this because we believe in information equality. Greater numbers of people can keep track of global events, understand their impact on people and communities, and become inspired to take meaningful action.

It helps you go deeper into key political issues and also introduces you to the diversity of research coming out of the continent. It's not about breaking news. It's not about unfounded opinions.

Significant Revisions
I hope you appreciated this article. Before you move on, I was hoping you would consider taking the step of supporting the Guardian‚Äôs journalism.
From Elon Musk to Rupert Murdoch, a small number of billionaire owners have a powerful hold on so much of the information that reaches the public about what‚Äôs happening in the world. The Guardian is different. We have no billionaire owner or shareholders to consider. Our journalism is produced to serve the public interest ‚Äì not profit motives.
And we avoid the trap that befalls much US media ‚Äì the tendency, born of a desire to please all sides, to engage in false equivalence in the name of neutrality. While fairness guides everything we do, we know there is a right and a wrong position in the fight against racism and for reproductive justice. When we report on issues like the climate crisis, we‚Äôre not afraid to name who is responsible. And as a global news organization, we‚Äôre able to provide a fresh, outsider perspective on US politics ‚Äì one so often missing from the insular American media bubble.
Around the world, readers can access the Guardian‚Äôs paywall-free journalism because of our unique reader-supported model. That‚Äôs because of people like you. Our readers keep us independent, beholden to no outside influence and accessible to everyone ‚Äì whether they can afford to pay for news, or not.
If you can, please consider supporting us just once from $1, or better yet, support us every month with a little more. Thank you.

Land acknowledgement
Embrace Autism recognizes and acknowledges the traditional lands of the Indigenous peoples across Ontario. From the lands of the Anishinaabe to the Attawandaron and Haudenosaunee, these lands surrounding the Great Lakes are steeped in First Nations history. We are in solidarity with Indigenous brothers and sisters to honour and respect Mother Earth. We acknowledge and give gratitude for the wisdom of the Grandfathers and the four winds that carry the spirits of our ancestors that walked this land before us. Embrace Autism is located on the Treaty Lands and Territory of the Mississaugas of the Credit. We acknowledge and thank the Mississaugas of the Credit First Nation‚Äîthe Treaty holders‚Äîfor being stewards of this traditional territory.

Help us celebrate nine years of Vox
Since Vox launched in 2014, our audience has supported our mission in so many meaningful ways. More than 80,000 people have responded to requests to help with our reporting. Countless teachers have told us about how they‚Äôre using our work in their classroom. And in the three years since we launched the Vox Contributions program, tens of thousands of people have chipped in to help keep our unique work free. We‚Äôre committed to keeping our work free for all who need it, because we believe that high-quality explanatory journalism is a public good. We can‚Äôt rely on ads alone to do that. Will you help us keep Vox free for the next nine years by making a gift today?
